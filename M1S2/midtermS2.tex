\section*{Instructions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Instructions}
 \begin{itemize}
	\item You may either type your work using this template, or you may handwrite your work and embed it as an image in this template. \textbf{If you choose to handwrite your work, the image must be legible, and oriented so that we do not have to rotate our screens to grade your work.} We have included some helpful LaTeX commands for including and rotating images commented out near the end of the LaTeX template.
	\item You should submit your work through the \textbf{class Gradescope page} only. Please submit one PDF file, compiled using this \LaTeX \ template.
	\item You may not need a full page for your solutions; pagebreaks are there to help Gradescope automatically find where each problem is. Even if you do not attempt every problem, please submit this document with no fewer pages than the blank template (or Gradescope has issues with it).

	\item You \textbf{may not collaborate with other students}. \textbf{Copying from any source is an Honor Code violation. Furthermore, all submissions must be in your own words and reflect your understanding of the material.} If there is any confusion about this policy, it is your responsibility to clarify before the due date. 

	\item Posting to \textbf{any} service including, but not limited to Chegg, Discord, Reddit, StackExchange, etc., for help on an assignment is a violation of the Honor Code.

	\item You \textbf{must} virtually sign the \hyperlink{HonorCode}{Honor Code}. Failure to do so will result in your assignment not being graded.
\end{itemize}

\begin{requiredHC}
\begin{itemize}
\item My submission is in my own words and reflects my understanding of the material.
\item Any collaborations and external sources have been clearly cited in this document.
\item I have not posted to external services including, but not limited to Chegg, Reddit, StackExchange, etc.
\item I have neither copied nor provided others solutions they can copy.
\end{itemize}

%\noindent In the specified region below, clearly indicate that you have upheld the Honor Code. Then type your name. 
\end{requiredHC}

\begin{proof}[I agree to the above, Tyler Huynh.]
%% Typing "I agree to the above," followed by your name is sufficient.

\section{Standard \standard: Graph Search (BFS/DFS)}

\setcounter{required}{\standard-1}
\begin{required} 
Consider the undirected, unweighted graph $G=(V,E)$ with $V=\{s,u,v,w,x\}$ and \\ \noindent $E=\{su,sv,sw,uw,ux,vw\}$, and let $T\subseteq E$ be $T=\{sv,sw,su,ux\}$. This is pictured below with $T$ represented by wide edges. 
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[
		wide/.style={line width=4pt},
		every node/.style={circle,draw,minimum size=16},
		scale=2]
		\node (v) at (-0.5,0)            {$v$};
		\node (u) at ($ (0,0) + ( 60:1)$) {$u$};
		\node (s) at ($ (0,0) + (-60:1)$) {$s$};
		\node (w) at ($ (u) + ( 1.5,0 )$) {$w$};
		\node (x) at ($ (s) + ( 1.5,0 )$) {$x$};
		\draw[wide] (s) -- (u);
		\draw (u) -- (w);
		\draw[wide] (s) -- (v);
		\draw[wide] (s) -- (w);
		\draw[wide] (u) -- (x);
		\draw (v) -- (w);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Carefully explain why $T$ cannot be output by depth-first search (DFS) with start vertex $s$, regardless of the order in which DFS adds vertices to its stack (when it has a choice of order).
\end{required}

\end{proof}

% Either type your answer in above, or uncomment the \includegraphics command
% and use it to insert an approprate image. Try experimenting with the scale 
% 0.9 the width option to resize your image if necessary.
