\section*{Instructions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Instructions}
 \begin{itemize}
	\item You may either type your work using this template, or you may handwrite your work and embed it as an image in this template. \textbf{If you choose to handwrite your work, the image must be legible, and oriented so that we do not have to rotate our screens to grade your work.} We have included some helpful LaTeX commands for including and rotating images commented out near the end of the LaTeX template.
	\item You should submit your work through the \textbf{class Gradescope page} only. Please submit one PDF file, compiled using this \LaTeX \ template.
	\item You may not need a full page for your solutions; pagebreaks are there to help Gradescope automatically find where each problem is. Even if you do not attempt every problem, please submit this document with no fewer pages than the blank template (or Gradescope has issues with it).

	\item You \textbf{may not collaborate with other students}. \textbf{Copying from any source is an Honor Code violation. Furthermore, all submissions must be in your own words and reflect your understanding of the material.} If there is any confusion about this policy, it is your responsibility to clarify before the due date. 

	\item Posting to \textbf{any} service including, but not limited to Chegg, Discord, Reddit, StackExchange, etc., for help on an assignment is a violation of the Honor Code.

	\item You \textbf{must} virtually sign the Honor Code (see Section \ref{HonorCode}). Failure to do so will result in your assignment not being graded.
\end{itemize}

\section{Standard 6: Safe and Useless Edges}

\setcounter{required}{5}
\begin{required} \label{Safe1}
Consider the following graph $G(V, E, w)$. Suppose we have the intermediate spanning forest $\mathcal{F}$ (indicated using thick edges) consisting of the edges $\{A, C\}$, $\{D, E\}$, and $\{E, F\}$. Clearly identify the safe, useless, and undecided edges, and justify your reasoning. [\textbf{Hint:} You may find Corollary 61 on page 42 of M. Levet's typed lecture notes to be helpful.]

\begin{proof}[Answer]
\begin{itemize}
\item The edge $\{A,B\}$ is... \textbf{safe} \\ % safe/useless/undecided
because ... the edge from $\{A,B\}$ is safe because from the component of $\{A,C\}$ this is the minimum edge weight to come from this component. Further, the edge $\{A,B\}$ does not create a cycle if it were to be added to the intermediate spanning forest of $\mathcal{F}$.%Your answer here
\item The edge $\{B,C\}$ is... \textbf{undecided} \\ % safe/useless/undecided
because ... this edge is not the minimum edge coming out of the component of $\{A,C\}$, however it does not create a cycle within our intermediate spanning forest of $\mathcal{F}$. %Your answer here
\item The edge $\{B, D\}$ is... \textbf{safe} \\% safe/useless/undecided
because ... the edge from $\{B,D\}$ is safe because from the component of $\{D, E, F\}$ it is the minimum edge weight that is coming out of this component. Further the edge of $\{B,D\}$ does not create a cycle within our intermediate spanning tree of $\mathcal{F}$. %Your answer here
\item The edge $\{C, E\}$ is... \textbf{undecided} \\ % safe/useless/undecided
because ... the edge of $\{C,E\}$ is undecided because it is an edge that exists between two different components where it is not the minimum edge weight to come out of either component. Further, it does not create a cycle within our intermediate spanning forest of $\mathcal{F}$.%Your answer here
\item The edge $\{D, F\}$ is... \textbf{useless} \\ % safe/useless/undecided
because ... the edge $\{D, F\}$ is useless because by the definition of a useless edge it will create a cycle within the component of $\{D, E, F\}$.%Your answer here
\end{itemize}
