\setcounter{required}{9}
\begin{required}
Consider the following flow network, with the following flow configuration $f$ as indicated below. 
\begin{center}
	\begin {tikzpicture}[-latex ,auto ,node distance =2 cm and 3cm ,on grid ,
	semithick ,
	state/.style ={ circle ,top color =white , bottom color = processblue!20 ,
	draw,processblue , text=blue , minimum width =1 cm}]

	\node[state] (A) {$s$};
	\node[state] (B) [above right = of A] {$B$};
	\node[state] (C) [below right = of A] {$C$};
	\node[state] (D) [right = of B] {$D$};
	\node[state] (E) [right = of C] {$E$};
	\node[state] (t) [below right = of D] {$t$};
	
	\path (A) edge node[below] {$1 / 7$} (B);
	\path (A) edge node[above] {$3 / 6$} (C);
	\path (B) edge node[left] {$0 / 1$} (C);
	\path (B) edge node[above] {$2 / 4$} (D);
	\path (E) edge node[right] {$3 /  5$} (B);
	\path (C) edge node[above] {$3 / 9$} (E);
	\path (E) edge node[right] {$0 / 3$} (D);
	\path (D) edge node[below] {$3 / 10$} (t);
	\path (E) edge node[above] {$1 / 5$} (t);
	
	% fix
	\node[state] (fix) [above right = of B] {F};
	\path (B) edge node[above left] {$2 / 2$} (fix);	
	\path (fix) edge node[left] {$1 / 1$} (D);
	\path (fix) edge node[above right] {$1 /1$} (t);
	\node[state] (fix2) [below = of C] {G};
	\path (A) edge node[below left] {$1 /1 $} (fix2);
	\path (fix2) edge node[below right] {$1 /1$} (E);
	\end{tikzpicture}  
\end{center}

\noindent Do the following (there are five parts, (a)--(e), continuing on to the next page).
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Given the current flow configuration $f$, what is the maximum \textit{additional} amount of flow that we can push across the edge $(B, D)$ from $B \to D$? Justify using 1-2 sentences.

\begin{proof}[Answer]
The maximum additional flow that we can push across the edge (B, D) from B $\rightarrow$ D would be a total flow of 2. We can push at most an additional flow of 2 from B $\rightarrow$ D.
\end{proof}


\vskip 10pt
\item Given the current flow configuration $f$, what is the maximum amount of flow that $B$ can push backwards to $E$? Do \textbf{not} consider whether $E$ can reroute that flow elsewhere; just whether $B$ can push flow backwards. Justify using 1-2 sentences.

\begin{proof}[Answer]
There is a flow of 3 being pushed back from B $\rightarrow$ E. Since there is a total amount of 3 flow being pushed from E $\rightarrow$ B, the residual amount of flow coming from B $\rightarrow$ E would have a capacity of 0 and a flow of -3 and the flow after some arithmetic would be a total of 3 from B $\rightarrow$ E.
\end{proof}



\vskip 10pt
\item Given the current flow configuration $f$, what is the maximum amount of flow that $D$ can push backwards to $E$? Do \textbf{not} consider whether $D$ can reroute that flow elsewhere; just whether $D$ can push flow backwards. Justify using 1-2 sentences.

\begin{proof}[Answer]
D cannot push and flow backward from D $\rightarrow$ E. This is due to the fact that there is no flow coming from the vertex of E, thus we cannot push back any flow.
\end{proof}


\newpage
\item How much \textit{additional} flow can be pushed along the flow-augmenting path $s \to B \to E \to t$? Do not include the current flow along these edges. Justify using 1-2 sentences.

\begin{proof}[Answer]
The additional flow that can be pushed along the flow-augmenting path from $s \to B \to E \to t$ would be a total of 3. This is due to the fact that there is already a flow of 3 from $E \to B$, the maximum amount of flow that we can push back to E on the edge of $B \to E$ would be three, thus the total amount of additional flow would be 3.
\end{proof}


\vskip 10pt
\item Find a second flow-augmenting path and indicate the maximum amount of additional flow that can be pushed along the path. Assume that the flow-augmenting path from part (d) has \textbf{not} been applied. Justify using 1-2 sentences.

\begin{proof}[Answer]
A second flow-augmenting path would be the from $s \to C \to E \to t$, for an additional flow of 3. This is due to the fact that from $S \to C$ we can only push a flow of 3 as the capacity is only 6 with a total flow of 3 already, thus our additional flow would be 3 on this flow-augmenting path from $s \to C \to E \to t$.
\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

For Problem 11, consider the following flow network.

		\node[vertex] (s) at (1,1) {$s$};
		\node[vertex] (u) at (2,2) {$u$};
		\node[vertex] (v) at (2,0) {$v$};
		\node[vertex] (w) at (3.5,2) {$w$};
		\node[vertex] (x) at (3.5,0) {$x$};
		\node[vertex] (t) at (4.5,1) {$t$};
	
		\draw[directed] (s) to [edge label =6] (u);
		\draw[directed] (s) to [edge label'=3] (v);
		\draw[directed] (u) to [edge label =2] (v);

		\draw[directed] (w) to [edge label =8] (x);
		\draw[directed] (x) to [edge label'=4] (t);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\noindent Do the following.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \subsection{Problem 11\ref{ff3a}}
    \item \label{ff3a} Consider the flow-augmenting path $s \to u \to v \to t$. Push as much flow through the flow-augmenting path and draw the updated flow network below (we have provided a tikzpicture in the LaTeX comments that you can use and just modify the labels on the edges, or you may hand-draw and embed an image).

\begin{proof}[Answer]
This would be the maximum amount of flow that can be pushed through on this flow-augmenting path. This is due to the fact that on the edges of $u \to v, v \to t$ the maximum amount of flow that can be pushed on these edges is 2.
%If you wish, you may un-comment the tikzpicture below (remove the \begin{comment} and \end{comment} lines) and modify
%the edge weights. You may also hand-draw and embed an image

    \subsection{Problem 11\ref{ff3b}}
    \item \label{ff3b} Find a flow-augmenting path starting from the updated flow configuration from your answer to part (a). Then do the following: (i) clearly identify both the new flow-augmenting path and the maximum amount of flow that can be pushed through said path; and then (ii) push as much flow through the flow-augmenting path and draw the updated flow network below.

    \begin{proof}[Answer]
    The new flow-augmenting path would be from $s \to u \to w \to t$. This path would have a maximum amount of flow of 1. It would have a maximum amount of flow of one because on the edge from $w \to t$ the capacity is only 1, so thus it restricts the rest of our path to only allow us to push a maximum flow of 1 through this path.

    \subsection{Problem 11\ref{ff3c}}
    \item \label{ff3c} Find a flow-augmenting path starting from the updated flow configuration from your answer to part (b). Then do the following: (i) clearly identify both the new flow-augmenting path and the maximum amount of flow that can be pushed through said path; and then (ii) push as much flow through the flow-augmenting path and draw the updated flow network below.

    \begin{proof}[Answer]
    The new flow-augmenting path would be $s \to v \to w \to x \to t$, with a maximum amount of flow being 3. The maximum amount of flow is only 3 because from the edges of $s \to v, v \to w$ the capacity for these edges are only 3, thus we can only push a maximum flow of 3 through this path.

    \subsection{Problem 11\ref{ff3d}}
    \item \label{ff3d} Using the flow configuration from part (c), finish executing the Ford--Fulkerson algorithm. Include the following here: (i) your flow network, reflecting the maximum-valued flow configuration you found, and (ii) the corresponding minimum capacity cut. There may be multiple minimum capacity cuts, but you should identify the one corresponding to your maximum-valued flow configuration. Then (iii) finally, compare the value of your flow to the capacity of the cut. \\

    \begin{proof}[Answer]
    Our final flow-augmenting path would be from  $s \to u \to w \to x \to t$, with a maximum capacity of 1. This path would only have a maximum capacity of 1 because from the edge $u \to w$ we have already pushed a flow on one through it thus, it can only hold a maximum flow of 1.
