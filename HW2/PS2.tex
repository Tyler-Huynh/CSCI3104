\section{Standard 3 -- Dijkstra's Algorithm}

\subsection{Problem~\ref{dij}}
\begin{required}\label{dij}

Consider the undirected weighted graph $G(V, E, w)$ pictured below. Work through Dijkstra's algorithm on the following graph, using the source vertex $a$. 
\textbf{Note: }In order to get full credits consider the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearly include the contents of the priority queue, the distance from $a$ and the parent of each vertex at each iteration.
    \item If you use a table to store the distances, clearly label the keys according to the vertex names rather than numeric indices (i.e., \texttt{dist[`B']} is more descriptive than \texttt{dist[`1']}).
    \item You do \textbf{not} need to draw the graph at each iteration, though you are welcome to do so. [This may be helpful scratch work, which you do not need to include.]
    \item Finally represent the shortest path graph.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=4]
        \node (a) at (-0.5,0) {$a$};
        \node (b) at ($ (0,0) + ( 60:1)$) {$b$};
		\node (f) at ($ (0,0) + (-30:0)$) {$f$};
		\node (g) at ($ (0,0) + ( -120:0.5)$) {$g$};
        \node (d) at ($ (g) + ( 2,0)$) {$d$};
		\node (c) at ($ (f) + ( 1,0)$) {$c$};
		\node (e) at ($ (c) + ( 1,0)$) {$e$};
        
		\draw (a) to["5"] (b);
        \draw (a) to["12"] (g);
        \draw (b) to["3"] (e);
        \draw (b) to["5"] (c);
		\draw (b) to["7"] (f);
        \draw (c) to["8"] (f);
        \draw (c) to["1"] (e);
        \draw (e) to["10"] (d);
        \draw (d) to["3"] (g);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{proof}[Answer]
Using Dijkstra's algorithm on this graph, starting from vertex "a", we will implement a priority queue as per what Dijkstra's algorithm does. \\

\textbf{The algorithm itself:}\\
We will first initialize a priority queue where the weights of each vertex will be set to infinity as there are no weights associated with it: \\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | }
 \hline
 Parent:& null & null & null & null & null & null & null\\ 
 \hline
 Distances:& a & b & c & d & e & f & g\\  
 \hline
 Weights: & $\infty$ & $\infty$ & $\infty$ & $\infty$ & $\infty$ & $\infty$ &$\infty$\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
Priority Queue: []
\end{center}

We will now push the vertex of "a" as it is our starting vertex to our priority queue:  \\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | }
 \hline
 Parent:& null & null & null & null & null & null & null\\ 
 \hline
 Distances:& a & b & c & d & e & f & g\\  
 \hline
 Weights: & $\infty$ & $\infty$ & $\infty$ & $\infty$ & $\infty$ & $\infty$ &$\infty$\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
Priority Queue: [(a, 0)]
\end{center}

From the vertex of "a" we can see the vertices of both "b" and "g" with distances of 5 and 12 respectively. We will pop off the vertex of "a" and push onto the vertices of "b" and "g" and update the parents vertexes.  \\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | }
 \hline
 Parent:& null & a & null & null & null & null & a\\ 
 \hline
 Distances:& a & b & c & d & e & f & g\\  
 \hline
 Weights: & $0$ & $\infty$ & $\infty$ & $\infty$ & $\infty$ & $\infty$ &$\infty$\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
Priority Queue: [(b, 5 ), (g, 12)]
\end{center}

From the vertex of "b" we can see the vertices of "c", "f", and "e". We will pop off the vertex of "b" and push onto our prioirty queue the vertices of "c", "f", and "e". \\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | }
 \hline
 Parent:& null & a &  b & null & b & b & a\\ 
 \hline
 Distances:& a & b & c & d & e & f & g\\  
 \hline
 Weights: & $0$ & $5$ & $\infty$ & $\infty$ & $\infty$ & $\infty$ &$\infty$\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{center}
Priority Queue: [(g, 12)]
\end{center}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Problem~\ref{Dijkstra2}} 
\begin{required}\label{Dijkstra2}
You have three batteries, with capacities of 40, 25, and 16 Ah (Amp-hours), respectively. The 25 and 16-Ah batteries are fully charged (containing 25 Ah and 16 Ah, respectively), while the 40-Ah battery is empty, with 0 Ah. You have a battery transfer device which has a ``source'' battery position and a ``target'' battery position. When you place two batteries in the device, it instantaneously transfers as many Ah from the source battery to the target battery as possible. Thus, this device stops the transfer either when the source battery has no Ah remaining or when the destination battery is fully charged (whichever comes first).  \\

\noindent But battery transfers aren't free! The battery device is also hooked up to your phone by bluetooth, and automatically charges you a number of dollars equal to however many Ah it just transfered.  \\
	
\noindent The goal in this problem is to determine whether there exists a sequence of transfers that leaves exactly 10 Ah either in the 25-Ah battery or the 16-Ah battery, and if so, how little money you can spend to get this result. \\
\noindent Do the following.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

	\subsubsection{Problem 2\ref{Dijkstra2a}}
	\item \label{Dijkstra2a} Rephrase this is as a graph problem. Give a precise definition of how to model this problem as a graph, and state the specific question about this graph that must be answered. [\textbf{Note:} While you are welcome to draw the graph, it is enough to provide 1-2 sentences clearly describing what the vertices are and when two vertices are adjacent. If the graph is weighted, clearly specify what the edge weights are.]

	\subsubsection{Problem 2\ref{Dijkstra2b}}
	\item \label{Dijkstra2b} Clearly describe an algorithm to solve this problem. If you use an algorithm covered in class, it is enough to state that. If you modify an algorithm from class, clearly outline any modifications. Make sure to explicitly specify any parameters that need to be passed to the initial function call. You need not write the algorithm.

	\subsubsection{Problem 2\ref{Dijkstra2c}}
	\item \label{Dijkstra2c} Apply that algorithm to the question. Report and justify your answer. Here, justification includes the sequences of vertices visited and the total cost. 
	\textbf{Note: }For full credits make sure to draw the graph with all the battery states. Then apply the algorithm that you have described until the desired final states are reached.

\section{Standard 4 -- Examples Where Greedy Algorithms Fail}

\setcounter{subsection}{2}
\subsection{Problem \ref{GreedyFail1}}
\begin{required} \label{GreedyFail1}
Recall the \textsf{Interval Scheduling} problem, where we take as input a set of intervals $\mathcal{I}$. The goal is to find a maximum-sized set $S \subseteq \mathcal{I}$, where no two intervals in $S$ intersect. Consider the greedy algorithm where we place all of the intervals of $\mathcal{I}$ into a priority queue, ordered earliest start time to latest start time. We then construct a set $S$ by adding intervals to $S$ as we poll them from the priority queue, provided the element we polled does not intersect with any interval already in $S$. \\

\noindent Provide an example with at least $5$ intervals where this algorithm fails to yield a maximum-sized set of pairwise non-overlapping intervals. Clearly specify both the set $S$ that the algorithm constructs, as well a larger set of pairwise non-overlapping intervals. \\

\noindent You may explicitly specify the intervals by their start and end times (such as in the examples from class) or by drawing them. \textbf{If you draw them, please make it very clear whether two intervals overlap.} You are welcome to hand-draw and embed an image, provided it is legible and we do not have to rotate our screens to grade your work. Your justification should still be typed. If you would prefer to draw the intervals using \LaTeX, we have provided sample code below.

\newpage
\subsection{Problem \ref{GreedyFail3}}
\begin{required} \label{GreedyFail3}
Consider now the \textsf{Weighted Interval Scheduling} problem, where each interval $i$ is specified by 
\[
([\text{start}_{i}, \text{end}_{i}], \text{weight}_{i}). 
\]

\noindent Here, the weight is an assigned value that is independent of the length $\text{end}_{i} - \text{start}_{i}$. Here, you may assume $\text{weight}_{i} > 0$. We seek a set $S$ of pairwise non-overlapping intervals that maximizes $\sum_{i \in S} \text{weight}_{i}$. That is, rather than maximizing the number of intervals, we are seeking to maximize the sum of the weights. \\

\noindent Consider a greedy algorithm which works identically as in Problem \ref{GreedyFail1}. Draw an example with at least 5 appointments where this algorithm fails. Show the order in which the algorithm selects the intervals, and also show a subset with larger weight of non-overlapping intervals than the subset output by the greedy algorithm. The same comments apply here as for Problem \ref{GreedyFail1} in terms of level of explanation.

We take as input an integer $n \geq 0$. The goal is to make change for $n$ using the fewest number of coins possible. \\

\subsection{Problem \ref{Exchange2}}
\begin{required} \label{Exchange2}
Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph. A \emph{vertex cover} of $G$ is a set of vertices $C$ such that for every edge $uv \in E$, either $u \in C$ or $v \in C$. That is, every edge of $G$ has at least one endpoint in $C$. 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Let $T$ be the graph
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
            \node (s) at (2,1) {$s$};
            \node (u) at (0,0) {$v$};
            \node (v) at (1,0) {$u$};
            \node (w) at (2,0) {$w$};
            \node (x) at (3,0) {$x$};
            \node (y) at (1,1) {$y$};
            \draw (u) -- (v);
            \draw (v) -- (w);
            \draw (w) -- (x);
            \draw (w) -- (y);
            \draw (y) -- (s);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Find a vertex cover $C$ of $T$ that includes the vertex $v$. 
    Now, explain why the set $C' = (C \setminus \{v\}) \cup \{u\}$ obtained from your $C$ by removing $v$ and adding (if it is not already present) $u$ is also a vertex cover of $T$.
    \item Now prove this property in general. That is, let $T$ be an arbitrary tree, suppose that $C$ is a vertex cover of $T$, and suppose that $C$ contains a leaf vertex $v$. 
    Let $u$ be the unique neighbor of $v$ in $T$, and let $C' = (C \setminus \{v\}) \cup \{u\}$ be the set of vertices obtained from $C$ by obtained from $C$ by removing $v$ and adding (if it is not already present) $u$. Carefully explain why $C'$ is a vertex cover of $T$.
