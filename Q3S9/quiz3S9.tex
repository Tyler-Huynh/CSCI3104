\section*{Instructions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Instructions}
 \begin{itemize}
	\item You may either type your work using this template, or you may handwrite your work and embed it as an image in this template. \textbf{If you choose to handwrite your work, the image must be legible, and oriented so that we do not have to rotate our screens to grade your work.} We have included some helpful LaTeX commands for including and rotating images commented out near the end of the LaTeX template.
	\item You should submit your work through the \textbf{class Gradescope page} only. Please submit one PDF file, compiled using this \LaTeX \ template.
	\item You may not need a full page for your solutions; pagebreaks are there to help Gradescope automatically find where each problem is. Even if you do not attempt every problem, please submit this document with no fewer pages than the blank template (or Gradescope has issues with it).

	\item You \textbf{may not collaborate with other students}. \textbf{Copying from any source is an Honor Code violation. Furthermore, all submissions must be in your own words and reflect your understanding of the material.} If there is any confusion about this policy, it is your responsibility to clarify before the due date. 

	\item Posting to \textbf{any} service including, but not limited to Chegg, Discord, Reddit, StackExchange, etc., for help on an assignment is a violation of the Honor Code.

	\item You \textbf{must} virtually sign the Honor Code (see Section \ref{HonorCode}). Failure to do so will result in your assignment not being graded.
\end{itemize}

\begin{requiredHC}
\begin{itemize}
\item My submission is in my own words and reflects my understanding of the material.
\item Any collaborations and external sources have been clearly cited in this document.
\item I have not posted to external services including, but not limited to Chegg, Reddit, StackExchange, etc.
\item I have neither copied nor provided others solutions they can copy.
\end{itemize}

%\noindent In the specified region below, clearly indicate that you have upheld the Honor Code. Then type your name. 
\end{requiredHC}

\begin{proof}[I agree to the above, Tyler Huynh.]
%% Typing "I agree to the above," followed by your name is sufficient.

\section{Standard 9: Huffman Coding}

\setcounter{required}{8}
\begin{required} 
Consider a message that uses the following letters with the specified frequencies:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
a & b & c & d & e \\ \hline
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
You should
\begin{itemize}
\item Specify the intermediate trees/forest constructed at each stage of Huffman's algorithm. You may specify your trees either by drawing them by hand \& including the images, using a LaTeX package such as TikZ, or with nested parentheses.\footnote{For example, $(a,b)$ denotes a tree with a single root and two children, $a$ and $b$; $((a,b), (c,d))$ denotes a perfect binary tree of depth 3 (including the root) with leaves $a,b,c,d$; $(c, (a,b))$ denotes a tree whose root has two children: $c$, and a node that, itself, has two children $a$ and $b$.}

\item Specify the encoding of each of the five letters.
\end{itemize}

\end{required}


\begin{proof}[Answer]
Below we will have the Huffman coding tree after running Huffman's algorithm: \\
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Huynh_CSCI3104_Q3S9.pdf}\\

The final encoding of the letters is as follows:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
a & b & c & d & e \\ \hline
1100% bit string encoding a goes here
 & 1101 %bit string encoding b goes here
 & 111%bit string encoding c goes here
 & 10%bit string encoding d goes here
 & 0 %bit string encoding e goes here
 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

% YOUR ANSWER HERE
\end{proof}

% Either type your answer in above, or uncomment the \includegraphics command
% and use it to insert an approprate image. Try experimenting with the scale 
% 0.9 the width option to resize your image if necessary.
