\section*{Instructions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Instructions}
 \begin{itemize}
	\item You may either type your work using this template, or you may handwrite your work and embed it as an image in this template. \textbf{If you choose to handwrite your work, the image must be legible, and oriented so that we do not have to rotate our screens to grade your work.} We have included some helpful LaTeX commands for including and rotating images commented out near the end of the LaTeX template.
	\item You should submit your work through the \textbf{class Gradescope page} only. Please submit one PDF file, compiled using this \LaTeX \ template.
	\item You may not need a full page for your solutions; pagebreaks are there to help Gradescope automatically find where each problem is. Even if you do not attempt every problem, please submit this document with no fewer pages than the blank template (or Gradescope has issues with it).

	\item You \textbf{may not collaborate with other students}. \textbf{Copying from any source is an Honor Code violation. Furthermore, all submissions must be in your own words and reflect your understanding of the material.} If there is any confusion about this policy, it is your responsibility to clarify before the due date. 

	\item Posting to \textbf{any} service including, but not limited to Chegg, Discord, Reddit, StackExchange, etc., for help on an assignment is a violation of the Honor Code.

	\item You \textbf{must} virtually sign the Honor Code (see Section \ref{HonorCode}). Failure to do so will result in your assignment not being graded.
\end{itemize}

\section{Standard 19: Solving Recurrences with the Tree Method}

\setcounter{required}{18}
\begin{required} 
\textbf{Using the tree method}, find a suitable function $f(n)$ such that $T(n) = \Theta(f(n))$. Show all work. You may without loss of generality assume that $n$ is a power of $4$; that is, $n = 4^{k}$ for some integer $k \geq 0$.

\begin{align*}
T(n) &= \begin{cases} 
3 & : n < 4, \\
3T(n/5) + n^2 & : n \geq 4.
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

\end{required}


\begin{proof}[Answer]
% YOUR ANSWER HERE
% Either type your answer in above, or uncomment the \includegraphics command
% and use it to insert an approprate image. Try experimenting with the scale 
% 0.9 the width option to resize your image if necessary.
